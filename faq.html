<h3 class="accent">How does a photo shoot with Creative Candids work?</h3>
I have a portable studio that I will bring to your home during a convenient time for your family. I will bring
backdrops, and lighting to your home, and set up a studio in the comfort of your home. I have props available
and will bring them to fit your needs. I have a baby poser available for babies who do not sit up yet. If you are
looking for specific props **please ask.**

<h3 class="accent">How long does the session take?</h3>
When I arrive it will take me about 20 minutes to set up the studio in your home. Then we will begin taking
photos. I will be at your home for about an hour and a half. It may take less or more time depending on <span class="accent">how it
goes</span>. I strive to create a no-stress environment, and will be patient with your family.

<h3 class="accent">What if my young child needs a break?</h3>
I understand that having your photo taken can be stressful for young children. If your child is old enough to
ask questions, this can be the best way to break the ice. I encourage them to ask what I am doing as I set up my
equipment so that they can become comfortable with the experience. For newborns and babies, I understand
that we may need to take a break in order for the baby to eat. Sometimes schedules can be unpredictable and I
understand that. Hungry babies do not photograph well, and it is always better to take a little break.

<h3 class="accent">Will my home be captured during the photo shoot?</h3>
Your home will not be in the images unless you request it. I have photographed families in front of their
Christmas tree, using a special piece of furniture or in a room without furniture. If you are looking to have a
photo in your home please let me know. Typically fireplaces do not make good backdrops because they are too
interesting and take away from the family being photographed.

<h3 class="accent">What should we wear?</h3>
Keep it simple! If you are trying to coordinate a family photo, lay out all of your clothes in advance, and make
sure that they do not clash. Clothes do not need to match exactly but should look nice together. Feel free to
have a few choices for your children, but keep in mind that depending on mood, we might not get to all of them.
Young babies look wonderful in white onesies, or with no clothes on at all!

<h3 class="accent">How many pictures will I have to choose from?</h3>
You will end up with 30-50 of the best images from the shoot.

<h3 class="accent">How much will an in-home photoshoot cost?</h3>
There is a sitting fee of $50, plus the cost of prints.<br/>
